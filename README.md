## Bitcoin Implementation in Rust

This repository, `bitcoin_implementation_in_rust`, is an endeavor to implement Bitcoin concepts and functionalities using the Rust programming language. It's inspired by the book "Programming Bitcoin" by Jimmy Song, available [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/). The book is a comprehensive guide to understanding the principles behind Bitcoin and provides a solid foundation for coding Bitcoin applications. This project aims to translate these principles into Rust, a language known for its performance and safety.

### Project Description

This project is a Rust-based implementation of Bitcoin. It focuses on creating a robust and efficient codebase that adheres to the concepts and methodologies discussed in "Programming Bitcoin". The choice of Rust as the programming language stems from its emphasis on safety, speed, and concurrency, making it an ideal candidate for implementing the critical and performance-sensitive aspects of Bitcoin.

### Goals and Objectives

- **Understand Bitcoin**: Deepen the understanding of Bitcoin's underlying technology as presented in "Programming Bitcoin".
- **Rust Programming**: Leverage Rust's features for building safe and efficient Bitcoin-related applications.
- **Open Source Contribution**: Provide a resource for others interested in Bitcoin and Rust, facilitating learning and contributions.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Rust: Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   - Basic Understanding of Bitcoin: Familiarity with Bitcoin concepts as covered in "Programming Bitcoin" is recommended.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/HermanObst/bitcoin_implementation_in_rust.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory and build:
     ```bash
     cd bitcoin_implementation_in_rust
     cargo build
     ```
